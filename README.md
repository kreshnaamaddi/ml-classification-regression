# ml-classification-regression
This project includes two machine learning tasks: Loan Approval Classification using SVM and Employee Salary Prediction using Polynomial Regression. Implements data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.




# üìä Machine Learning Capstone Project  

This repository contains two machine learning projects:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Loan Approval Classification (SVM)** ‚Äì Uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict loan approval based on applicant attributes like income, credit score, loan amount, and employment length.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Employee Salary Prediction (Polynomial Regression)** ‚Äì Implements Polynomial Regression to estimate employee salaries based on experience, education level, and performance score.  

## üìå Project Objectives  

- **Loan Approval Classification (SVM)**  
  - Predict whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant details.  
  - Use **SVM** with different kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) and tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.  
  - Evaluate model accuracy and performance.  

- **Employee Salary Prediction (Polynomial Regression)**  
  - Predict employee salaries based on experience, education level, and performance score.  
  - Use **Polynomial Regression** to model non-linear relationships in salary trends.  
  - Optimize model by selecting the best polynomial degree and evaluate performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.  

## üõ† Technologies Used  

- **Python**  
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì Machine Learning Models  
- **Pandas & NumPy** ‚Äì Data Handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì Data Visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts** ‚Äì Implementation
